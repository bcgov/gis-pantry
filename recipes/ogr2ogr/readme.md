# ogr from BCGW
This is a script that allows you to grab a dataset or filtered subset from the BC data Catalogue (BCGW) and translate it to one of several geospatial formats:

* GeoPackage - QGIS' native format, similar to a geodatabase. Works in QGIS and ArcGIS 10.3, 10.6 and ArcPro
* GeoJSON - very lightweight, easy-to-read format. Can drag-and-drop into QGIS
* KML - Google Earth layers
* ESRI Shapefile - ESRI Shapefile
* More will be added..

#### The script does the following:
* <span style="color:green">takes user input for desired output format ("GPKG", "GeoJSON", "KML", or "ESRI Shapefile"), path and filename</span>
* <span style="color:green">creates an ogr2ogr command line interface (CLI) string - this is the string you would use to run ogr2ogr in the OSGeo4W shell</span>
* <span style="color:green">executes the CLI string from within the Python script (via the subprocess module)</span>

*That's it - your geospatial file will be found in your specified path after running the script.*

### Notes
* <span style="color:lightblue">There are several usage examples embedded within the script; these provide good examples of how to use SQL to filter a BCGW dataset by attributes or spatial extent.</span>
