# Description

Do you own many web maps that all need to have their default view/scale changed? Look no further than this script.
This script was originally created because I had 50 maps in EB that were all inconsistent in scale. 
This was the easiest way to fix that.


# Dependencies/Requirements/Environments

* Packages/modules required 
- Python v 3 + 
- ArcGIS API for Python
- getpass

* Specific python environment required

This script is easily called from opening a Notebook in ArcGIS Pro. No additional setup or installation required.

# Known Bugs/Limitations


The script only works if all your web maps have the same prefix.
