## SUMMARY

Useful Logging Template  
Use this to set up logging for scripts as desired  
Copy, paste, modify, GO...

This set up logs to the terminal, to a .log file, and to a special filtered .log file.  
It also has a function defined that makes most log calls as simple as a print statement

Note: 
It's also possible to set up logging using config files. This template does not do that, but just mentioning it in case it's of interest.
It provides an easy way to set up logging without having to put the configuration within each script using code.   
If I create a config file in the future, then I will add it along with sample code to use it...
