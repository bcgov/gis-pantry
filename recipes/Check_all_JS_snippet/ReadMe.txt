Purpose: for use as an in-browser snippet for BC Government online forms that require all boxes to be checked.
Primarily used for "Map Report Conflicts" screen in FTA prior to clicking "Resolve Selected Conflicts". It is recommended that "save and excepts" or "excluding thereouts" etc be manually added.

Code provenance: script supplied by Brian McDonald to James Burton on December 11, 2019 

Dependancies: JavaScript enabled. Please find online resources to check if JS is enabled in your browser.

For implementation of this code within a Internet Explorer browser:

To enable the ‘Check All’ function in IE, you will need to add the custom javascript code as the url of a Favourite within your Internet Explorer settings.  

The easiest way to do this is to create a ‘dummy’ Favourite in IE (using any webpage – say, the Google splash screen), renaming it as ‘Check All Function’ or something like that.  Then from the ‘Favourites’ window/tab in IE, right-click your ‘dummy’ Favourite and open its ‘Properties.’  Paste the javascript code into the URL textbox to update.


For implementation of this code within a Google Chrome browser: 

Within the DevTools (Crtl-Shift-i), navigate to the sources tab, where you can access a “Snippets” section. This platform allows you to save code used frequently, such as Check_all. I created a “Snippet” called Check_all and copied and pasted the javascript within the "Snippet" console. Save the script to a script folder on your drive. To run the code you simply open the devtools, navigate to your desired "Snippet" and run it by pressing ctrl-enter.
