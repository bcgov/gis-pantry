# Oracle-to-QGIS
Purpose is to improve efficiency of large datasets from oracle to QGIS by applying sql statements prior to creating/exporting layers 

The class created in the script reduces the table size through the use of SQL statements and then calls on simple geoprocessing functions created in Qgis. Data can be used or exported based on user preferences.
