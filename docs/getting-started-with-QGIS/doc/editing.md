## Attribution
1. When creating a new feature in a layer with attributes, a pop up will apread asking you to fill in the new features attributes.

2. To edit attributes on existing feature, open the attribute table, make sure editing is enabled and click into the attribute field to edit the value. (Depending on your settings, you may need to select the features for them to appear in the attribute table).

1. Open the attribute table
2. Make sure editing is enabled
3. Click add field
4. Fill in the field details

## Moving and adding vertices
1. Turn editing on for the desired layer
2. Select the vertex tool from the editing toolbar
3. Hover over a polygon, red circles will appear on its vertices, click a vertex to begin moving it and click again to place it in a new location or right click to release it to its original location.
4. To add a vertex to an edge, hover over the edge and a grey "+" will appears. Click the "+" to add a vertex, move it to the desired location, and click again to place it there or right click to restore the original edge.

## Snapping
1. Add the snapping toolbar by right clicking in the toolbar area and checking the snapping option. 
2. Click the red magnet to enable snapping
3. By default, the tolerance is 12 px and snapping is set to vertices only. Change this to vertices and segments if you wish to snap to anywhere on an edge.

## Topological editing
Topological editing allows you to easily maintain connections between nodes and edges when editing vertices. 
It can be enabled in the snapping toolbar.
