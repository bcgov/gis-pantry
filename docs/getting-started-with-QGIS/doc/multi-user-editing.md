## What is PostgreSQL / PostGIS and why do you need it?
PostgreSQL (pronounced "postgres" by these authors) is an open source object-relational database system that came out of the University of California, Berkeley in the 1980's (https://www.postgresql.org/about/).

PostGIS is an add on for PostgreSQL that spatially enables the database (https://postgis.net/).

## What is the versioning plugin

Our team has dived into using PostGIS on the recommendation from our architecture specialists as an open-source solution to allow for multiple users to access, edit, and save changes concurently without the risk of locked datasets and lost changes. A plugin has been developed for QGIS by Oslandia for versioning PostGIS databases (https://github.com/Oslandia/qgis-versioning). (Our architecture specialists are busy setting up our database and testing is commencing now, so this project is still in it's infancy).

## Connecting to a PostgreSQL Database
1. Right click PostGIS in your Browser panel and add a New Connection.
2. Enter the parameters of the existing PostGIS database. You may enter your credentials here or choose to enter them later.
3. Test the connection, a ribbon will appear to let you know if it was successful.
4. You may also want to see tables without geometry, if so, select the box next to "Also list tables with no geometry".
5. Select OK. You will now be able to add data layers from within the schemas of your PostGIS to the project.
