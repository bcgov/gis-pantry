## Quick Tips
1. Turn on/off panels from the View -> Panels menu
2. Tool bars can be activated by either using the View --> Toolbars menu or right-clicking on the toolbar area above the map area
3. Layer styling can be achieved through either the layer properites dialog or the layer styling panel.  The layer styling panel provides you with the great feature of live updates on map.
4. Some processing toolsets are accessed from the Vector/Raster menus and some are accessed from the processing panel.

The Locator widget can be used to quickly access everything in QGIS from layers to processing algorithms.
