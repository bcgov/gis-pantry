## Accessing Labels
Labels can be enabled and configured from two locations: 
1. The label dialog in the styling window <br>
![label-options-styling-panel-gif](../images/label-options-styling-panel.gif)
2. The Layer Properties Labels tab <br>
![label-options-layer-properties-dialog-gif](../images/label-options-layer-properties-dialog.gif)

In both configuration dialogs the options for labeling are identical.

## Label Text
Label text is controlled by the value setting which can be set using a field or by using an expression. Fields can be set using the drop down dialog or an expression can be built using the expression editor.

In the expression dialog, fields and values can be coerced into the desired output value. An 'output preview' of the result can be seen in the bottom left of the dialog.<br>
Expression examples: <br>
1. Concatenate two fields
    ```
    Field2 || Field3
    ```
2. The length of line features concatenated with units<br>
    ```
    round($length,1) || ' m'
    ```

## Label Options
Label options can be set using dropdown selections or radio buttons. Most options can also be set using fields or expressions. For example the size of a polygon label can be set to be dependent on the geometry area.

The options are broken down into groups:
- Text Options (font, style, size, colour, opacity)
- Formating (type case, spacing, orientaiton, blending, line wrapping, numerical formatting)
- Buffer(Control buffer mask size, colour, opacity, etc)
- Background (create and control a background for your label)
- Shadow (drop shadow effect control)
- Callouts (draw and control line style between feature to label)
- Placement (placement relative to feature, repeating and overun controls, geometry generation, data defined locations, label priority)
- Rendering (mulitpart control, duplication reduction, feature label limits, feature priority)

## Label Bar

The label bar contains several tools to help you edit your labels. From left to right these tools are:
- Layer Labeling Options: Opens the layer styling panel
- Layer Diagram Options: Opens a dialog allowing the user to add diagrams as labels
- Highlight Pinned Labels and Diagrams: Highlights labels that fixed in place due to manual placement
- Toggle Display of Unplaced Labels: Turns on/off unplaced labels
- Pin / Unpin Label or Diagram: Pins a label or diagram label in place on click (or unpins with shift + mouse click)
- Show / Hide Labels or Diagrams: Allows turning on and off labels for currently active features
- Move Label: Allows moving of labels and diagrams
- Rotate Label: Rotate label or diagram
- Change Label Properties: Change the properties (font weight, buffer, font size, etc) of individual labels on a map
