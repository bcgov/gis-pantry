# About QGIS Plugins

[home](../README.md)

[QGIS Plugin repository](https://plugins.qgis.org/)

Plugins in QGIS add useful features to the software. Plugins are written by QGIS developers and other independent users who want to extend the core functionality of the software. These plugins are made available in QGIS for all the users.

# Core Plugins

Core plugins are already part of the standard QGIS installation. To use these, you just need to enable them.

  1. Open QGIS. Click on Plugins ‣ Manage and Install Plugins.... to open the Plugin Manager dialog.

  2. Even if this is your first time using QGIS, you will see a lot of plugins listed under the Installed tab. This is because they are Core Plugins and were installed during QGIS installation.

  3. Let’s enable one of the plugins. Check on the checkbox next to Spatial Query Plugin. This will enable the plugin and you will be able to use it. One thing to note is that plugins have the ability to insert menu items at various locations and create new panels and toolbars. Sometimes it is difficult to know how to find the newly enabled tools. Once clue is to look in the plugin discription. Here the description says Category: Vector. That indicates that the plugin would be found under the Vector menu once enabled. Click Close.

  4. Now that the Spatial Query Plugin is enabled, you can go to the Vector ‣ Spatial Query to use the functionality added by the plugin.

  # External Plugins
  External plugins are available in the QGIS Plugins Repository and need to be installed by the users before using them. An easy way to browse and install these plugins is by using the Plugin Manager tool.
  1. Open QGIS. Click on Plugins ‣ Manage and Install Plugins.... to open the Plugin Manager dialog.

  5. If you noticed, there was no mention of the plugin category in the description. That makes it hard to determine how to access the newly installed plugin. Most external plugins are installed under the Plugins menu itself in QGIS. Click on Plugins ‣ QuickWKT and you will see the newly installed plugin. Usually, external plugins also install a button in the Plugins toolbar also. You may also use that button to access the plugin.
