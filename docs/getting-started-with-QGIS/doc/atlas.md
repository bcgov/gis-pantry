# QGIS Atlas: Map Series Generation
Atlas is the automated map series generator for QGIS. Point, line, and polygon features can be used to generate and export a series of maps derived from the input feature geometery.

The QGIS documentation provides detailed usage and some ideas for advanced features such as changing page orientation, attribute driven table generation, and combining atlas with expressions.
