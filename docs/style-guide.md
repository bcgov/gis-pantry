# Style Guide
The page title is a level one heading. Keep it close to the same as the filename. Following the title there should be a short description of what the page is about.

Follow this general discription with a page index as follows.

## Index
* [Subheadings](#Subheadings)
* [Image Use](#Image-use)

## Subheadings 
Should be a level 2 heading

If there is a lot of information for a topic break it the topic down into smaller docs and provide a TOC near the top of the main doc for the topic.

**The GIS pantry is for orginal content only. If the information is already published by someone else use links to reference it**

## Image use
The largest images should be 900x650 and used when building animated gifs showing workflow and annotating software components.

```
When showing small script / code samples use code blocks
