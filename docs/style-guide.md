# Style Guide
The page title is a level one heading. Keep it close to the same as the filename. Following the title there should be a short description of what the page is about.

Follow this general discription with a page index as follows.

## Index
* [Subheadings](#Subheadings)
* [Image Use](#Image-use)

## Subheadings 
Should be a level 2 heading

If there is a lot of information for a topic break it the topic down into smaller docs and provide a TOC near the top of the main doc for the topic.

**The GIS pantry is for orginal content only. If the information is already published by someone else use links to reference it**

## Image use
The largest images should be 900x650 and used when building animated gifs showing workflow and annotating software components.

## GIF Progress Bar
When recording GIFs in Screen To GIF, please add a progress bar to make it easier to tell where the beginning and end are. 
To do this, in the editing window, go to the image tab and select "Progress" from the ribbon.
For consistency, use a 16pt bar in HEX: #589632 (Dark Green)

```
When showing small script / code samples use code blocks
```
