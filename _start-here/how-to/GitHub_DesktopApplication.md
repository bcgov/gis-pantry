   - Click on the "Clone" button to initiate the cloning process. The repository will be downloaded to your chosen location.

3. **Create a new branch:** In GitHub Desktop, select the repository you cloned from the left sidebar. Then click on the "Current Branch" dropdown button, and choose "New Branch." Give your branch a descriptive name that reflects the changes you plan to make.

4. **Make changes:** Use your favorite code editor or file explorer to make the necessary changes to the files within the cloned repository on your computer.

In GitHub Desktop, you can click on the "Create Pull Request" button in the lower-right corner of the app to open the repository on the GitHub website and create a pull request there.

9. **Provide details for the pull request:** On the GitHub website, provide a descriptive title and additional comments to explain your changes. Review the changes and make sure everything looks good before submitting the pull request.
