# What is Markdown and How To Use It

## What is Markdown???

> Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the worldâ€™s most popular markup languages. - [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)

Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax. It is used to create websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, emails, and technical documentation. GitHub uses GitHub Flavored Markdown ([GFM](https://github.github.com/gfm/#:~:text=GitHub%20Flavored%20Markdown%2C%20often%20shortened,a%20strict%20superset%20of%20CommonMark.)) which is a strict superscript of [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) (a rationalized version of Markdown syntax). Although Markdown has its syntax, HTML, JavaScript, and GeoJson elements and tags can also be used to format your text and create diagrams and visualizations. More information on Markdown can be found [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)

## How to use Markdown
Markdown files are saved as a .md extension, then using plain text and markdown [syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/), the document is formatted

>#### <u>Example Code</u>
>```
># Heading
>Headings are represented by the # symbol and the number of #'s used represents the heading level
>
>## Heading 2 
> If the following elements are used they will produce horizontal a horizontal rule
>
>---
>***
>
>### Heading 3
>Text formatting can use Markdown or HTML, for example 
>- *Italic* or <i>Italic</i> <br>
>- while **can represent bold** or <b> can represent bold</b>
>- Markdown does not include a built-in <u>underline</u> element but HTML tags support <ins>underlines</ins> with different ways to produce the same effect
