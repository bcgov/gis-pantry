# gis-pantry
The gis-pantry is a repository for GIS related scripts, tools and recipes. The intent of this repository is to aid BC Government employees in sharing and continual improvement of tools, stand-alone scripts, and recipes (script snippets). Contribute to the bin you think best matches your code.
* Tools are developed to do a specific job and often come with a user-interface and documentation that non-scripting users might be able to figure out enough to use.
* Stand-alone scripts could be a tool that isn't fully developed yet or a library of useful methods or classes that can be reused.  Sometimes your script might do a purpose-built task that can be re-configured for another persons purposes.
* Recipes are small scripts/snipits or instructions that don't nessesarrly do anything on their own but can be copied, changed and pieced together to make something more complete.

## Contributing
We encourage contributions. Please see our [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/bcgov/gis-pantry/issues) guidelines. BC Government employees should also ensure they review [BC Open Source Development Employee Guide](https://github.com/bcgov/BC-Policy-Framework-For-GitHub/blob/master/BC-Open-Source-Development-Employee-Guide/README.md) 
* Contribute tools and plugins into tools, standalone scripts and modules to scripts, and small snips and script examples to recipes.
* Please do your best to document your scripts and provide tool documentation 

## When to make your own BCGOV repository
If you have a large project that will have multiple contributors or has a complicated code base and documentation your project would be best served by its own repository. If you contribute to this repository you can always move out when things grow.
