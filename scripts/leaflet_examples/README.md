# Setting Up a Webpack + Leaflet Project with TypeScript

## Prerequisites
1. Install Node.js on your computer (if you donâ€™t already have it) - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

## Project Setup
2. Create a folder for your project  
3. Open the folder in VS Code  
4. Open the terminal  

## Initialize Node and Webpack
5. Initialize the project with Node:

   ```
6. Fill out all the information to create a `package.json` file.  
7. Install Webpack:  
   ```sh
   npm install --save-dev webpack
   ```
8. Initialize Webpack:  
   ```sh
   npx webpack init
   ```
9. Install Webpack CLI generators (Command Line Interface to make life easier) by following the Webpack init prompt.  
10. You might need to initialize Webpack again after installing Webpack CLI generators:  
    ```sh
    npx webpack init
    ```

    ```sh
    npm install leaflet
    ```
13. Install Esri Leaflet:  
    ```sh

    ```
15. Install Esri Leaflet TypeScript definitions:  
    ```sh
    npm install --save-dev @types/esri-leaflet
    ```

## Development & Testing
16. Write your code/application (`TypeScript + HTML + SASS`).  
17. To compile and test:  
    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```
18. To test on a local server:  
    ```sh
    npm run serve
    ```
